=====================================
Perseus Exercise Renderer for Kolibri
=====================================

What is Kolibri?
----------------

Kolibri is a Learning Management System / Learning App designed to run on low-power devices, targeting the needs of
learners and teachers in contexts with limited infrastructure. A user can install Kolibri and serve the app on a local
network, without an internet connection. Kolibri installations can be linked to one another, so that user data and
content can be shared. Users can create content for Kolibri and share it when there is network access to another
Kolibri installation or the internet.

See `learningequality.org <https://learningequality.org/kolibri/>`__ for more info.


What is Perseus?
----------------

Khan Academy's exercise question editor and renderer.

See https://github.com/Khan/perseus for more info.


What is this plugin?
--------------------

A Perseus renderer wrapper for Kolibri that can track learning progress and save to the database.


Installation
------------

**This plugin is bundled with Kolibri**. If you are running a custom version,
you can install it like this:


1. Inside your Kolibri virtual environment::

    pip install kolibri-perseus-exercise-plugin

2. Activate the plugin::

    kolibri plugin exercise_perseus_renderer enable

3. Restart Kolibri.


Development guide
-----------------

1. Download this repo.

2. Open terminal in your Kolibri repo.

3. run the following commands, with your Kolibri development virtual env
   enabled::

    pip install -e <KOLIBRI-PERSEUS-PLUGIN-LOCAL-PATH>

    kolibri plugin kolibri_exercise_perseus_plugin enable

4. Then run the commands to install frontend packages in Kolibri, this plugin
   will have its dependencies recursively installed::

    yarn install

Make sure that this message **DOES NOT** appear in your logging output of
``yarn install``, it means that you are not using the development version::

    WARNING  assets/src/module.js not found for plugin exercise_perseus_render_module.

5. After cloning for the first time, or if you made any changes to the project,
   you need to rebuild it::
     
     make assets


Updating translation strings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**This is currently broken, download files manually from CrowdIn**

To download the latest translation strings for this plugin, make a ``crowdinSecrets.js`` file from the template in the repo root, and put your kolibri project API key in there. The KA API key can be set to null. Then execute the following commands::

    cd kolibri_exercise_perseus_plugin
    yarn run download-translations


Updating Perseus
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case you update Perseus (bundled in this repo), please run this command
afterwards::

    make assets


Release plan and version scheme
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The versioning of this plugin does not follow Kolibri's release plan. We plan to
make it possible to upgrade and distribute this plugin independently from
Kolibri, as with all other plugins.

That means that the versioning and releasing of
``kolibri_exercise_perseus_plugin`` is unrelated to both Kolibri and Perseus.


Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Development installation version not active**

If you ran ``make dist`` or ``make pex`` on Kolibri with ``kolibri-exercise-perseus-plugin==x.x.x`` present in ``kolibri/requirements/base.txt``, Kolibri will generate an ``exercise_perseus_renderer`` instance inside its ``kolibri/dist`` folder and bundle it for further distribution. That means manually installing ``exercise_perseus_renderer`` for development won't take any effects. One way to fix this issue is to run ``make clean`` on Kolibri.


How to publish to PyPi?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. Follow the instructions above to installing the plugin for development.
2. From the Kolibri directory run the frontend build command.
3. update `setup.py` to a newer version.
4. Terminal move to the root level of repo dir and run the following command to publish to PyPi::

    make release
